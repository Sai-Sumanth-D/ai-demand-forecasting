# AI Demand Forecasting

Welcome to **AI Demand Forecasting ** – your smart, location-aware energy forecasting solution. This project harnesses the power of AI and real-time weather data to generate highly accurate, contextual energy usage predictions for businesses, utilities, and smart cities.

---

## 🚀 What is AI Demand Forecasting?
AI Demand Forecasting is a real-time energy prediction system that helps users forecast their electricity demand with precision. It is built to:

- Adapt to geographic location and seasonality
- Use **real-time weather data** to refine predictions
- Incorporate **calendar-based patterns** (weekday/weekend, holidays, etc.)
- Provide **hourly-level demand forecasts**

This solution is ideal for energy management, resource optimization, and smart infrastructure planning.

## 🔧 Key Features
- **Real-Time Forecasting**: Integrates live weather and timestamp data.
- **Location-Aware Intelligence**: Tailors forecasts to the user’s city/state.
- **Gen AI Powered**: Uses Groq API and LLMs for intelligent, language-based analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for fast and interactive visualizations.
- **API-First Design**: Backend in Flask, modular and easily extendable.
